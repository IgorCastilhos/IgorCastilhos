ðŸŒŸ From Administration to Innovation: My Journey in Information Systems ðŸŒŸ

OlÃ¡! I'm Igor, a passionate Brazilian student currently halfway through my Information Systems degree. My journey started in the world of Administration, where I honed my skills in finance and organizational management.

My first professional experience was as an intern at a dynamic law firm. There, I learned the importance of precision and attention to detail, skills that are indispensable in any field. However, my curiosity and drive led me to the bustling halls of Banco do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (Banrisul), one of the largest financial institutions in our state.

At Banrisul, I didn't just handle numbers; I delved into the heart of financial operations, contributing to projects that streamlined processes and enhanced customer experiences. This exposure to the intricate workings of the financial sector ignited my interest in technology and its potential to revolutionize industries.

This passion for tech and finance led me to switch gears and dive into the world of Information Systems. Now, as a student in this exciting field, I'm combining my administrative expertise with cutting-edge technological skills to pave the way for a future where finance and technology intersect seamlessly.

I am proficient in analyzing complex data, developing strategic solutions, and implementing innovative technologies that drive efficiency and growth. My background in administration provides a solid foundation for understanding the broader business context, while my studies in Information Systems equip me with the tools to tackle tomorrow's challenges.

Looking ahead, I am eager to contribute to projects that leverage technology to solve real-world problems, particularly in the financial sector. Whether it's developing software solutions, enhancing cybersecurity measures, or driving digital transformation, I'm ready to make an impact.

Let's connect and explore how we can shape the future together!
